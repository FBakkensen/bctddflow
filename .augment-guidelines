# Powershell
- PowerShell scripts should NEVER be executed using the execute_command tool from the desktop-commander MCP.
- Users should ALWAYS use the Terminal application directly to execute PowerShell scripts.
- Using Desktop Commander to execute PowerShell scripts can lead to:
    - Unpredictable script execution behavior
    - Security context issues
    - Incomplete error reporting
    -Potential system instability
